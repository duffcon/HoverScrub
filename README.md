# HoverScrub

### What:
A simple demo controlling video playback using the mousemove event in HTML5. This is not meant to replace video playback, just provide another option. I dusted off after effects and made a simple animation that gets chaotic at the end. Comprehending such a video will require one to rewatch it forwards and backwards.

Note: The playback is controlled only by the x position but I didn't want him to get lonely so I kept the y position in.

### Why:

Cleaner look. Boredom.

### How:

Javascript, JQuery, HTML.
